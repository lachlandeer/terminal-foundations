# Finding Files and File Content


## Finding Files

```bash
$ find [path] [expression]
```

* helpful versions:
    * `$ find . -type d`; find directories in current working directory
    * `$ find . -type f`; find files in current working directory
    * `$ find . -maxdepth 1 -type f`; restrict the depth of search to current level
    * `$ find . -mindepth 2 -type f`; find all files that are two or more levels below
    * `$ find . -name *.txt`; find all txt files

## Finding Lines Within a File

```{bash}
$ grep [pattern] [file ...]
```

* example: print lines containing "beta":

```{bash}
$ history | grep find
```

* Options include:
    * `-w` word; restrict matches to lines containing the word on its own (i.e., if beta, not beta1)
    * `-i` insensitive; makes search case-insensitive
    * `-n` number; number the lines that match
    * `-v` invert; print the lines that do not match
    * with `""` phrase;

* check `man grep`


## Regular expressions

* `grep` becomes powerful when combined with *regular expressions*

* Regex are used to identify *regular strings*;
    - specific strings such as phone numbers or email addresses ...
    - or anything you know how to specify


## Regular Strings?

* What is a regular string?
    - It’s any string that can be generated by a series of linear rules,

* Examples:
    1. Write the letter "a" at least once.
    2. Contains the letter "b" exactly five times.
    3. Starts with a certain pattern.
    4. Ends with a certain pattern.
    5. Contains certain group of characters

* Can chain these rules together


## Example: Valid Email addresses

* Rule 1: The first part of an email address contains at least one of the following: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, the numbers 0-9, periods (.), plus signs (+), or underscores (_).

* Rule 2: After this, the email address contains the @ symbol.

* Rule 3: The email address then must contain at least one uppercase or lowercase letter.

* Rule 4: This is followed by a period (.).

* Rule 5: Finally, the email address ends with *com, org, edu,* or *net*
    - in reality, there are many possible top-level domains

Solution:
```
[A-Za-z0-9\._+]+@[A-Za-z]+\.(com|org|edu|net)
```

## Commonly used regular expressions

| Symbols   | Meaning                                 | Example             | Ex Matches            |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| `*` | Matches the preceding character, subexpression, or bracketed character, 0 or more times | `a*b*` | `aaaaaaaa, aaabbbbb, bbbbbb` |
| `+` | Matches the preceding character, subexpression, or bracketed character, 1 or more times | `a+b+` | aaaaaaaab, aaabbbbb, abbbbbb |
| `[]` | Matches any character within the brackets (i.e., “Pick any one of these things”) | `[A-Z]*` | `APPLE, CAPITALS, QWERTY` |

|------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| `()` | A grouped subexpression (these are evaluated first, in the “order of operations” of regular expressions) | `(a*b)*` | `aaabaab, abaaab, ababaaaaab` |
| `{m, n}` | Matches the preceding character, subexpression, or bracketed character between m and n times (inclusive) | `a{2,3}b{2,3}` | `aabbb, aaabbb, aabb` |

|-----------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| `[^]` | Matches any single character that is not in the brackets | `[^A-Z]*` | `apple, lowercase, qwerty` |
| `|` | Matches any character, string of characters, or subexpression, separated by the `“|”` (a vertical bar, or “pipe,” not a capital “i”) | `b(a|i|e)d` | `bad, bid, bed` |
| `.` | Matches any single character (including symbols, numbers, a space, etc.) | `b.d` | `bad, bzd, b$d, b d` |

|-----------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| `^` | Indicates that a character or subexpression occurs at the beginning of a string | `^a` | `apple, asdf, a` |
| `\` | An escape character (this allows you to use “special” characters as their literal meaning) | `\. \| \\` | `. | \` |

|---------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| `$ ` | Often used at the end of a regular expression, it means “match this up to the end of the string.” Without it, every regular expression has a defacto `“.*”` at the end of it, accepting strings where only the first part of the string matches. | `[A-Z]*[a-z]*$` | `ABCabc, zzzyx, Bob` |

|------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|
| `?! ` | “Does not contain.” This pairing of symbols, immediately preceding a character (or regular expression), indicates that that character should not be found in that specific place in the larger string. If trying to eliminate a character entirely, use in conjunction with a `^` and `$` at either end. | `^((?![A-Z]).)*$` | `no-caps-here, $ymb0ls a4e f!ne` |
